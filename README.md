# Introduction
This is a (very very) simple LaTeX template for SJTU Master Thesis.
For those seeking for a general solution, I recommend you to checkout [this repo][gitrepo] (it is a more official version I think).

The reason I created my own template bypassing the official one is that I cannot make the font accompanied in that template work on my box, even the demo cannot be compiled :(.
I cannot guarantee my template 100-percent meets the requirements, but I'm sure at least 80-percent does.
And it is light-weighted than the 400+ lines of commands.
